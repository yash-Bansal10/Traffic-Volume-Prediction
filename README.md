# 🚗 Traffic Volume Prediction Using Weather and Time Data

This project predicts traffic volume on interstate highways using regression analysis based on weather conditions and time-related features. It is built using Python and scikit-learn, and utilizes the *Metro Interstate Traffic Volume* dataset from Kaggle.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

The objective of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict the number of vehicles passing through a highway at any given time based on environmental and temporal data.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach

- *Model Used*: Linear Regression  
- *Features Used*:
  - Temperature (temp)
  - Rain (rain_1h)
  - Snow (snow_1h)
  - Cloudiness (clouds_all)
  - Hour of the day
  - Day of the week
  - Month
  - Weekend indicator (is_weekend)
  
- *Target*: traffic_volume (Number of vehicles)
